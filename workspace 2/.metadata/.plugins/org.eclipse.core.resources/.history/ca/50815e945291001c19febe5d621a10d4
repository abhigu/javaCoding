#What is it?
The goal of this coding project is to simulate the propagation of a virus, and the various factors that go into simulating such a process. This includes infection an death rates, incubation and healing, as well as random mutations that might change the simulation. 
Another goal of this project is to help condense my coding knowledge into a single piece, and to essentially show what I know and what I can do.
